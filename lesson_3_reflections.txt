When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

-Keeping all my work local may result in the loss of files. By saving my work online, I can easily catch up with what I left over wherenever I have internet access.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

-Because sometimes there're some changes that other collaborators made which I do not want to have on my computer.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

-Forking is a built-in function on GitHub that clones other people's repositories on your GitHub. Clone is a function that clones a remote repository on GitHub to a local address, or a local address to a local address. Branching describes the process of creating another branch to save new commits.
