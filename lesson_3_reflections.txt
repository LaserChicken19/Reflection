When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

-Keeping all my work local may result in the loss of files. By saving my work online, I can easily catch up with what I left over wherenever I have internet access.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

-Because sometimes there're some changes that other collaborators made which I do not want to have on my computer.
