When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

-Keeping all my work local may result in the loss of files. By saving my work online, I can easily catch up with what I left over wherenever I have internet access.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

-Because sometimes there're some changes that other collaborators made which I do not want to have on my computer.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

-Forking is a built-in function on GitHub that clones other people's repositories on your GitHub. Clone is a function that clones a remote repository on GitHub to a local address, or a local address to a local address. Branching describes the process of creating another branch to save new commits.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

-When you are collaborating with someone on a project, your changes of a file may result in conflict with another people, which leads to a conflict between the local version of the commit and the online version. Using git fetch to create a local copy of the last known state of the remote can help you see the different between master and origin/master. You can then resolve the conflict by merging and push or by pulling.
